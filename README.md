## About the Project
TikTakToeFX 2.01 is a refined version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using JavaFX platform. This version introduces a more modular and organized code structure by separating the game logic into multiple classes.

- **Refactored Code:** The codebase has been refactored to improve modularity and readability by extracting game logic into separate classes.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** The project architecture has been redesigned to support easier integration of new features and scalability.
- **Streamlined Gameplay:** Unnecessary comments, variables, and methods have been removed to streamline the gameplay experience.
- **New Branch:** The changes introduced in this version have been saved as a new branch (2.01) to track the project's evolution.

## Features
